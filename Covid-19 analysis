### 📊 **Dashboard Components**

The report includes the following sections:

1. **Global Overview**

   * Total cases, deaths, vaccinations
   * Interactive KPI cards and world maps

2. **Day-wise Case Trends**

   * Daily new cases and deaths
   * Line charts with time filters

3. **Country-Level Comparison**

   * Top 10 affected countries
   * Mortality and vaccination rates

4. **Anomalies & Waves**

   * Highlighting spikes during Delta/Omicron variants
   * Visual decomposition of death trends

5. **Vaccination Progress**

   * Percentage of population vaccinated
   * Comparative bar graphs and maps

---

### 📌 **Insights from the Analysis**

* The **highest death tolls** occurred in the **USA, India, Brazil**, and **Russia**.
* **Case surges** closely aligned with the emergence of **Delta and Omicron variants**.
* **Vaccination programs** in countries like the UK and UAE significantly reduced new deaths.
* **Mortality rates** were notably higher in countries with aging populations and limited healthcare infrastructure.
* **Anomalies** such as reporting delays and sudden surges were handled using DAX flags or filters in the model.

---

### ⚙️ **Technical Aspects**

* **Data Source**: Our World in Data / JHU CSSE COVID-19 dataset
* **Tools Used**: Power BI Desktop, DAX Measures, Power Query
* **Custom DAX Measures**:

```DAX
Mortality Rate = DIVIDE(SUM(Deaths), SUM(Cases)) * 100  
Vaccination Rate = DIVIDE(SUM(People_Vaccinated), SUM(Population)) * 100  
Anomaly Flag = IF(New_Cases > 1.5 * Avg_Cases, "Spike", "Normal")
```

### ✅ **Conclusion**

This Power BI project provides a clear, interactive, and data-driven view of the COVID-19 pandemic. It enables users to:

* Monitor the spread and control of the virus
* Compare country responses
* Understand the role of vaccinations in pandemic mitigation

The insights can support **public health strategies**, **emergency preparedness**, and **policy planning**.
